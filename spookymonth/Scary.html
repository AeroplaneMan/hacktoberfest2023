  <title id="halloween">THE MONTH OF OCTOBER</title>
  <h1>October has one date people are mostly focused on and that is...</h1>
  <title>HALLOWEEN!!!!!!!!!</title>
  <p>So here, I'll tell you the good halloween candy to give/get.</p>
  <h1>Snickers</h1>
  <p>Snickers are a great candy to give away and get for trick or treating, the small sizes are ideal since the regular sized bars are probably too expensive.</p>
  <h1>Milky Way</h1>
  <p>Milky Ways are also a great candy. It's basically like Snickers with caramel inside. Again the smaller ones are more ideal.</p>
  <h1>Twix</h1>
  <p>Are you left Twix or right Twix? Either way it's a good candy to get, it's like a Milky Way but more crunchier.</p>
  <h1>I don't have time to do other candies. but I hoped you liked my small list of some Halloween candy.</h1>
